This project was developed as part of the Object-oriented Programming course of the Telecommunications and Computer Engineering bachelor degree at Iscte-iul.

I developed a Sokoban game (popular strategy game) using concepts of object oriented programming such as Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism and Abstraction.

Built the gameâ€™s engine and logic.

The GUI (GraphPack) was provided and therefore not developed by me. 

There is a UML diagram that shows the relations between classes.
